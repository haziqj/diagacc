Haziq: could you please give below the steps that you use to generate
the data with the gold standard. I outline what I think it should be the
steps: Within each replication, the data are generated as follows:

1.  item class probabilities for six items (the sixth item is the gold
    standard that has sensitivity and specificity 1) and prevalence are
    set (2 latent classes are assumed).

2.  Posterior probabilities are computed for each respondent (n=250 or
    n=1000).

3.  Given the respondentâ€™s latent class you generate the binary
    indicators for the six items. Unless there is 100% missigness of the
    gold standard in which case you only generate five items.

4.  After a data set is being generated, the three models are fitted and
    you report the parameter estimates (item class probabilities and
    prevalence for all items, asymptotic standard errors).

    -   In the case of 20% and 50% missing data in item 6 you still fit
        the model to all six items and treat the missigness as missing
        at random. since you use ML there should be no problem. you
        should also get estimates for the 6th item that should be close
        to one. is that true? when the gold standard is missing 100%
        then you only estimate parameters for the five items.

5.  The above steps are repeated R times where R is the number of
    replications.

We compute the bias and mean squared error (MSE) for each parameter as
follows:$$Bias=\frac{1}{R}\sum_{i=1}^{R}\left(\hat{\theta}_{i}-\theta\right)\:,$$
and
$$MSE=\frac{1}{R}\sum_{i=1}^{R}\left(\hat{\theta}_{i}-\theta\right)^{2}\:,$$
where $R$ here is the number of valid replicates, $\hat{\theta}_{i}$ is
the estimate of a parameter or of its asymptotic standard error at the
$i^{th}$ valid replication, and $\theta$ is the corresponding true
value. In the case of standard errors, where the true value $\theta$ is
unknown, the standard deviation of parameter estimates across valid
replications is used (those are the standard deviations that you report
in the output). My understanding is that you do not compute any
asymptotic standard errors.

-   we can present the bias and MSE of the parameters using graphs and
    in particular lines where each dot on the line will represent an
    item. The x-axis will be the items. the y-axis will be the bias or
    MSE. We do not need to include any confidence levels.

How to present the results: Our aim is to compare the three different
models when each one of those model is true (data generating mechanism)
each time:

-   Figure 1: bias of parameter estimates (sensitivities), n=250,
    p=0.04, gold standard=20,40,100, Models:LC,LCRE,FM. (total of 9

-   Figure 2: bias of parameter estimates (specificities), n=250,
    p=0.04, gold standard=20,40,100, Models:LC,LCRE,FM. (total of 9
    lines)

    (sensitivities), n=250, p=0.04, gold standard=20,40,100,
    Models:LC,LCRE,FM. (total of 9 lines).

-   Figure 8: MSE of estimated asymptotic standard errors
    (specificities), n=250, p=0.04, gold standard=20,40,100,

The above can be repeated for p=0.80. Figures 1-4 are for bias and MSE
of item class probabilities (sensitivities and specificities) and
Figures 5-8 are for bias and MSE for estimated standard errors.
